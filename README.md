## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
### Final project for Getting and Cleaning Data Course

* The project is about creating an R script file named run_analysis.R.

* The codes are written in run_analysis.R file as described below:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* The repo includes a README.md file to explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

* The repo also includes a code book that describes the variables, data, and any transformations, which is called CodeBook.md.
